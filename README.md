# abap-doc-export
Generates a HTML export from ABAP Doc comments within abap source code

[ABAP Doc](https://blogs.sap.com/2013/04/29/abap-doc/) allows documentation of ABAP source code right within the code itself. 

The documentation can be exported to HTML files in Eclipse ADT. This utility allows to generate the documentation from any abap source. 
The main purpose of abap-doc-export is to be used in CI of an [abapGit](abapgit.org) project.
